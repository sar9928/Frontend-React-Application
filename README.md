This project was created by Stoney Reed. To get the project to work you more than likely will have to download/install these items.

Here is a list of things I have downloaded or installed while developing this application:

download node: 
### downloaded latest node off website

install react:
### npm install -g create-react-app

Install Axios:
### npm i axios

Install Nodemon:
### npm install -g nodemon

Install Pagination:
### npm install paginate-array


I created my react app using these commands:
## npx create-react-app my-app
## cd my-app
## npm start

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
